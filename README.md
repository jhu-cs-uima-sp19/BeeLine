Beeline is a service that seeks to create ridesharing groups to lower the cost of going from point A to point B(ee). The most recent iteration of our Android application enables users to view their user profile and planned trips, in addition to finding and creating new trips.

You must also include a README file that details what features have been completed so far and the general state of your app to make it easier for your mentor to test and grade.
