Beeline is a service that seeks to create ridesharing groups to lower the cost of going from point A to point B(ee). The most recent iteration of our Android application enables users to view their user profile and planned trips, in addition to finding and creating new trips.

 ## General State of the App To-Date
 Our current version is able to log in a user, create a new user, and show a user's personal beelines when they enter our app. If a user is not part of a Beeline, they can navigate to the find beeline page to search through the current offerings. If they don't find one that meets their needs, they can create a brand new beeline from point A to point B(ee). All of these actions are updated via the Firebase Database to keep user actions attached to their profile. Speaking of the user profile, a user can update their profile with information about themselves or the payment method they use for ridesharing, while getting to see other profiles in their ride. Some whimsical features we have included include our custom loading screen featuring a loading bee while a user is taken from activity to activity. Our future plans include adding more on-boarding to our app, with informative messages on how to get your beelines started and where to go to find more.
